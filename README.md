## Danny's Diner Case Study

## Introduction

Danny's Diner is a cozy restaurant that specializes in serving three of Danny's favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. However, despite its charm, Danny's Diner is facing challenges in understanding its customer behavior, spending patterns, and menu preferences. Danny believes that leveraging data can help him make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and grow his business.

## Problem Statement

Danny seeks assistance in analyzing the data collected during the first few months of Danny's Diner's operation. He wants answers to the following questions:

1. **Customer Visiting Patterns**: Danny wants to understand when his customers visit the diner, helping him plan staff schedules efficiently.

2. **Customer Spending Habits**: Danny is interested in knowing how much money customers spend on average during their visits.

3. **Favorite Menu Items**: To improve the menu, Danny wants to identify which menu items are the most popular among customers.

Additionally, Danny needs help in creating basic datasets to facilitate data inspection without the need for SQL expertise. He has provided three key datasets for this case study:

- `sales`: Contains transactional data related to customer orders.
- `menu`: Includes information about the items available on the menu.
- `members`: Holds data about Danny's Diner loyalty program members.

## Pizza Runner Case Study

Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza are consumed daily worldwide? Danny certainly does! Inspired by the idea of combining 80s retro styling with pizza, he launched Pizza Runner. This venture involves delivering fresh pizzas to customers using a team of runners and a mobile app.

## Available Data

Danny recognized the importance of data collection for Pizza Runner's growth. He has provided an entity relationship diagram (ERD) of his database design. However, he needs assistance in cleaning the data and performing basic calculations to optimize Pizza Runner's operations.

All datasets for both Danny's Diner and Pizza Runner exist within the `pizza_runner` database schema. Please reference this schema when working with the data and addressing the case study questions.
